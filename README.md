# IGT RRA02645 - developer's task

## Description

Please find the attached one page mock of desktop and mobile versions. This should be done responsive and might be different on tablet.

Develop this in React using Material UI (https://mui.com/) and add Theming (Theme 1 and Theme 2 â€“ so we can switch the theme of styles).

Please send back to this email with completed task. If any install is required, please update README accordingly.

Feel free to use images of your own choice. You can use less, sass or styled components.

A bonus would be lazy mock data loading and use of mui skeleton (Optional).

You can use CRA (Create React App) as a base, if required.
